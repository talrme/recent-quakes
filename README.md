# Live Earthquake Map

An interactive web application that displays recent earthquakes around the world in real-time. Built with vanilla JavaScript and Leaflet.js.

## Features

- **Real-time Data**: Fetches earthquake data from the USGS API
- **Interactive Map**: 
  - Click markers to view detailed earthquake information
  - Hover over markers to see magnitude and location
  - Smooth animations when focusing on earthquakes
- **Customizable View**:
  - Adjust time range (1-30 days)
  - Filter by minimum magnitude (0-7+)
  - Sort earthquakes by time or magnitude
- **Earthquake List**:
  - View all earthquakes in a scrollable list
  - Click to focus on the map
  - Minimizable panel for better map visibility
- **Statistics**:
  - Total number of earthquakes
  - Count in last 24 hours
  - Strongest earthquake
  - Total energy release
  - Time since last earthquake
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Works on desktop and mobile devices
  - Adjusts layout for different screen sizes

   - Use the sort toggle to switch between time and magnitude sorting

3. **Earthquake List**:
   - View all earthquakes in a scrollable list
   - Click any earthquake to focus on the map
   - Minimize the list for better map visibility
   - Sort by time or magnitude

4. **Statistics**:
   - View key statistics in the bottom-left panel
